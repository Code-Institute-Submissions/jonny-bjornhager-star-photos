# Star Photos photo & video agency

## The purpose of this site:

- To provide users with photography services directed at suburban, nature or wedding photos.

## Deployment procedure

The first step of the procedure is to come up with a design that is easy on the eyes and simple to understand.

Once the design is roughly done the steps taken were:

1. Creating a navbar that is easy and fairly simple to use even on smaller screens.

   - The navbar is built using flexbox.
   - It scales with the site when increasing/decreasing in size.

2. Creating the hero backgound image.

3. Creating the main and gallery page using css grid for photos.

When each part of the site (i.e header, footer, main page etc) had been tweaked of fully created, I staged it to be pushed to github using the Git version control system.
